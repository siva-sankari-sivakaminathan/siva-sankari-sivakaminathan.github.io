I built this website using the dynamic duo of HTML and CSS for its core structure and visual style.  

‚≠êThink of HTML as the skeleton and CSS as the muscles and skin, giving the site its form and function. 

‚≠êJavaScript adds interactivity, like the nervous system bringing everything to life with animations and user actions.  

‚≠êBootstrap, a pre-built design toolkit, acts like a toolbox filled with components to speed up development and ensure the site looks great on any device, just like pre-fabricated elements can streamline construction. 

‚≠êFinally, I leveraged the power of Netlify for hosting. Netlify offers a user-friendly platform with features like automatic deployment, taking the burden off me and letting me focus on creating the best website experience possible.  In essence, this combination of technologies empowers me to craft a website that's not just informative but also visually stunning and engaging.
